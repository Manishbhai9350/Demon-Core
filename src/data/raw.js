// Raw 

// In 1945, a small sphere of plutonium rested at Los Alamos Laboratory.
// It was unfinished. Silent. And extremely dense.

// It was intended for a third atomic weapon.
// The war ended before it was ever used.

// The core was capable of reaching a state known as criticality —
// when a nuclear reaction sustains itself.

// Surrounding materials could reflect neutrons back into the core,
// increasing the reaction without any visible change.

// Scientists conducted hands-on experiments,
// manually adjusting reflectors around the core.

// Safety protocols were informal by modern standards.
// The danger was understood, but not yet fully respected.

// On two separate occasions,
// the core was accidentally pushed beyond criticality.

// The reactions were brief.
// The consequences were not.

// Following the accidents,
// hands-on criticality testing was discontinued.

// The core itself was melted down and repurposed.

// The Demon Core left no monument.
// Only procedures, protocols, and memory.

// It remains a reminder
// of how invisible forces demand restraint.
